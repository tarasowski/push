You can create a script to automate this workflow and integrate it into your main development process. Below is a shell script (`push.sh`) that implements the described setup. It requires the **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** and assumes you are comfortable with shell scripting and basic Git operations.

### Script: `push.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Exit on error
set -e

# Function to display usage
usage() {
    echo "Usage: $0 \"Pull Request Title (with optional #issue reference)\""
    exit 1
}

# Check if a title was provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    usage
fi

# Variables
PR_TITLE="$1"                                   # Pull Request title from argument
BRANCH_NAME="temp-branch-$(date +%s)"          # Unique branch name with timestamp
MAIN_BRANCH="main"                             # Main branch name
REMOTE="origin"                                # Remote name (default is 'origin')

# Step 1: Create and checkout a new branch
git checkout -b "$BRANCH_NAME"

# Step 2: Add all changes and commit
git add .
if git diff-index --quiet HEAD --; then
    echo "No changes to commit."
    exit 0
fi
git commit -m "$PR_TITLE"

# Step 3: Push the new branch to GitHub
git push "$REMOTE" "$BRANCH_NAME"

# Step 4: Open a Pull Request using GitHub CLI
gh pr create --base "$MAIN_BRANCH" --title "$PR_TITLE" --body "Automated PR: $PR_TITLE"

# Step 5: Merge the Pull Request (requires GitHub CLI)
gh pr merge --auto --delete-branch

# Step 6: Cleanup local branch
git checkout "$MAIN_BRANCH"
git branch -d "$BRANCH_NAME"

# Done
echo "Pull request created, merged, and cleaned up successfully!"
```

### How to Integrate This Script

1. **Save the Script**  
   Save the script above to a file, e.g., `push.sh`. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x push.sh
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Install the **GitHub CLI**: [GitHub CLI Installation Guide](https://cli.github.com/).
   - Ensure you are authenticated in `gh` by running:
     ```bash
     gh auth login
     ```

3. **Set Up Your Git Repository**  
   Ensure you have a Git repository with the `main` branch set up. You should also have permissions to push to and manage branches.

4. **Usage**  
   When you're ready to push changes, use the script like this:
   ```bash
   ./push.sh "Fixes #123: Correct login logic and improve performance"
   ```
   - This will:
     - Create a branch.
     - Commit all staged changes with the specified message.
     - Push the branch to GitHub.
     - Create a PR with the title.
     - Automatically merge the PR and clean up the branch.

5. **Optional Integration**  
   - Add the script to your `PATH` for easy use from anywhere:
     ```bash
     mv push.sh /usr/local/bin/push
     ```
   - Now, you can run `push` from any Git repository:
     ```bash
     push "Closes #456: Implement caching for API responses"
     ```

### Key Points for Your Workflow

- **Script Customization:**  
  Adjust the branch naming convention or add more options if needed, such as setting a PR description.

- **Release Notes:**  
  With this setup, every PR title will become part of your commit history, and tools like GitHubâ€™s release note generator will automatically use them.

- **Handling Merge Conflicts:**  
  If a merge conflict occurs during `gh pr merge`, you will need to resolve it manually.

- **Working Off `main`:**  
  This script aligns with your strategy of minimizing branch management while still leveraging PRs for tracking and linking to issues.
