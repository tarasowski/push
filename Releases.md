Sure! Below are the step-by-step commands you can use to generate a **Git tag** and create a **GitHub release** with **automatic release notes** (including fixed issues, merged PRs, etc.).

### **1. Create a Git Tag**

Before you create a release, you need to **tag** the commit you want to release. Tags are like "markers" for a specific commit in your Git history.

#### **Command to Create a Tag:**
```bash
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0: Added feature X and fixed bug Y"
```
- `-a v1.2.0`: This specifies the tag name (`v1.2.0`), which is the version you want to release.
- `-m "Release v1.2.0: Added feature X and fixed bug Y"`: This is the message associated with the tag (optional but useful).

#### **Push the Tag to GitHub:**
After you create the tag, you need to **push the tag** to GitHub to make it available for the release.
```bash
git push origin v1.2.0
```

### **2. Create a GitHub Release with Automatic Notes**

Once the tag is pushed, you can create a **release** on GitHub, and it will automatically generate release notes based on merged pull requests and closed issues.

#### **Command to Create a Release with Automatic Notes:**
```bash
gh release create v1.2.0 --title "Release v1.2.0" --generate-notes
```

- `v1.2.0`: This is the **tag name** you created earlier (the version number of your release).
- `--title "Release v1.2.0"`: This is the **title** of the release (you can modify it as needed).
- `--generate-notes`: This option automatically generates release notes based on merged pull requests and closed issues, making it easy to see what changes are included in the release.

### **Optional: Attach Files to the Release**

If you have compiled files (e.g., `.zip`, `.tar.gz`, etc.) to distribute along with your release, you can attach them to the release.

#### **Command to Attach Files to the Release:**
```bash
gh release create v1.2.0 --title "Release v1.2.0" --generate-notes --assets ./build/output/*.tar.gz
```
- `--assets ./build/output/*.tar.gz`: This will attach any `.tar.gz` files found in the specified directory (e.g., your build or output directory).

### **3. Final Release Creation Flow**
Here is the complete process from tagging to creating a release:

1. **Tag your code:**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0: Added feature X and fixed bug Y"
   ```

2. **Push the tag to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin v1.2.0
   ```

3. **Create the release with automatic release notes:**
   ```bash
   gh release create v1.2.0 --title "Release v1.2.0" --generate-notes
   ```

---

### **What Happens After These Commands:**
- The **tag (`v1.2.0`)** will mark the commit in your Git history.
- **GitHub will generate release notes** based on:
  - Merged pull requests.
  - Closed issues referenced in the PRs (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- **The release will appear on GitHub** under the "Releases" section of your repository, showing the tag name, release notes, and any attached assets.

### **Note:**
- You can also manually edit or customize the release notes later via the GitHub web interface if you need to add more specific information or context.
  
By following these steps, you ensure that your releases are well-documented, and users can easily see what changed in each version.
